# Forecasting Import Value of Lampung Province

This study aims to compare the method of high-order Chen fuzzy time series and feedforward backpropagation artificial neural network in forecasting the import value of Lampung Province based on MSE and MAPE values.  The results showed that the feedforward backpropagation artificial neural network forecast the import value of Lampung Province better than the high-order fuzzy Chen time series method with lower MSE and MAPE values.
